# 🗂️ Leave Management System (LMS)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Chitranshi-18/LMS)  

A group project for managing student leave requests, approvals, and tracking, with a focus on **database design and SQL implementation**.  

---

## 💼 My Contribution

- Designed an **ER diagram** and implemented a **normalized MySQL schema** capturing core entities:  
  `Student`, `Warden`, `HOD`, `Admin`, `Leave Request`  
- Built **SQL queries** to:  
  - Retrieve leave records  
  - Calculate approved leaves  
  - Support eligibility validation  
  - Generate leave slips  
- Assisted in mapping the **leave approval workflow** through database relationships  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Frontend and backend components (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS) were implemented by other team members. My focus was **database design and SQL logic**.
